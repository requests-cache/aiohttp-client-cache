Thanks to [Roman Haritonov](https://github.com/reclosedev) and
[contributors](https://github.com/reclosedev/requests-cache/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md)
for the original `requests-cache`! `aiohttp-client-cache` reuses some backend code from `requests-cache`, so a copy of its license is included [here](https://github.com/JWCook/aiohttp-client-cache/blob/main/LICENSE_requests_cache.md).

And thanks to the following individuals for contributing to `aiohttp-client-cache`:

* [Andrew Kursar](https://github.com/akursar)
