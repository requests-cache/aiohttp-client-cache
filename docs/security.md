## Pickle Vulnerabilities

:::{warning}
The python `pickle` module has [known security vulnerabilities](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html),
potentially leading to code execution when deserializing data.
:::

This means it should only be used to deserialize data that you trust hasn't been tampered with.
Since this isn't always possible, aiohttp-client-cache can optionally use
[itsdangerous](https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com) to add a layer of security around these operations.
It works by signing serialized data with a secret key that you control. Then, if the data is tampered
with, the signature check fails and raises an error.

## Creating and Storing a Secret Key

To enable this behavior, first create a secret key, which can be any `str` or `bytes` object.

One common pattern for handling this is to store it wherever you store the rest of your credentials
([Linux keyring](https://itsfoss.com/ubuntu-keyring),
[macOS keychain](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-keychains-to-store-passwords-mchlf375f392/mac),
[password database](https://keepassxc.org), etc.),
set it in an environment variable, and then read it in your application:

```python
>>> import os
>>> secret_key = os.environ['SECRET_KEY']
```

Alternatively, you can use the [keyring](https://keyring.readthedocs.io) package to read the key
directly:

```python
>>> import keyring
>>> secret_key = keyring.get_password('aiohttp-example', 'secret_key')
```

## Signing Cached Responses

Once you have your key, just pass it to {py:class}`.CachedSession` or {py:func}`.install_cache` to start using it:

```python
>>> from aiohttp_client_cache import CachedSession, RedisBackend

>>> cache = RedisBackend(secret_key=secret_key)
>>> async with CachedSession(cache=cache) as session:
>>>     await session.get('https://httpbin.org/get')
```

You can verify that it's working by modifying the cached item (_without_ your key):

```python
>>> cache_2 = RedisBackend(secret_key='a different key')
>>> async with CachedSession(cache=cache) as session_2:
>>>     cache_key = list(await session_2.cache.responses.keys())[0]
>>>     await session_2.cache.responses.write(cache_key, 'exploit!')
```

Then, if you try to get that cached response again (_with_ your key), you will get an error:

```python
>>> async with CachedSession(cache=cache) as session:
>>>     await session.get('https://httpbin.org/get')
BadSignature: Signature b'iFNmzdUOSw5vqrR9Cb_wfI1EoZ8' does not match
```
